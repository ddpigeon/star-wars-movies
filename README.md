# Link to the project
The code can be found here [here](https://dd-pigeon.github.io/star-wars-movies/).

# Steps followed to make the project

1. Using `BeautifulSoup` the imdb website was scraped and a list of all the Star Wars movies were retrieved.
2. They were dumped into a JSON file.
3. A HTML file was created and `script` tag was used to directly pull data from the JSON file into the HTML site.
4. Some additional formatting was done to beautify the website.

# Setup on a local system
The code is written using vanilla HTML, so there's no requirement of any setup. However the file call only works on a secured server, i.e. `https://`, so it runs on the website specified.
